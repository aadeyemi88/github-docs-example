## Step One: Using Code Blocks

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code. 
A Google Cloud Engineer uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Becasue it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

*CodeBlock Example:*

```
# Get the user's name
print "Enter your name: "
name = gets.chomp

# Greet the user
puts "Hello, #{name}! Welcome to the Ruby programming world."
```
